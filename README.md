# Hand written MLP
- preprocessing data
- parameter search
- pipelining
- **models used**: Hand written MLP vs library (Scikit-learn) MLP
- **dataset**: MNIST handwriting dataset
- **goal**: implementing the backpropagation learning algorithm for a multilayer (input, one hidden layer and one output layer) in the following two different ways to learn to classify handwritten characters using the MNIST training dataset and the corresponding label dataset.
    1. Hand written MLP without any libraries
    2. MLP using scikit-learn
- full_dumentation file provides more detail on modeling results and comparison
